### Because I got marked as absent in one of my classes for not connecting fast enough
It will automatically connect you at the appropriate to the right meeting, as long as you set up your json correctly. 
For it to work, you must enable the "Always open these types of links in the associated app" on your default browser. 
From what I know, Chrome disabled this feature in v76. If you use Chrome, sucks to be you. 
Use a good browser like Firefox. 
Offset in the JSON is optional. If an offset is specified, it will connect that much sooner. 
`i.e. offset: 5 -> connects 5 minutes sooner.`
